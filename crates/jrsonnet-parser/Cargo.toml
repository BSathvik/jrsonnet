# Implement serialization of AST using structdump
#
# Structdump generates code, which exactly replicated passed AST
# Contrary to serde, has no code bloat problem, and is recommended
#
# The only limitation is serialized form is only useable if built from build script

# Implement serialization of AST using serde
#
# Warning: as serde doesn't deduplicate strings, `Source` struct will bloat
# output binary with repeating source code. To resolve this issue, you should either
# override serialization of this struct using custom `Serializer`/`Deserializer`,
# not rely on Source, and fill its `source_code` with empty value, or use `structdump`
# instead
