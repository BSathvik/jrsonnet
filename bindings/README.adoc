= Native bindings

Bindings are implemented in form of standard libjsonnet.so implementation.

Headers are described in `c/libjsonnet.h`, this file is exact copy from `C` implementation of jsonnet,
plus additional jrsonnet-specific methods.

Bindings should work as drop-in replacement for standard impl.

cross build --release -p libjsonnet --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
