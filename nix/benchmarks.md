# Benchmarks

There are multiple implementations of jsonnet implemented in different languages: Rust (this repo), [Go](https://github.com/google/go-jsonnet/), [Scala](https://github.com/databricks/sjsonnet), [C++](https://github.com/google/jsonnet), [Haskell](https://github.com/moleike/haskell-jsonnet).

For simplicity, I will call these implementations by the language of their implementation.

Unfortunately, I haven't managed to measure performance of Haskell implementation, because I wasn't able to build it, and there is no binaries published anywhere, so this implementation is omitted from the following benchmarks
